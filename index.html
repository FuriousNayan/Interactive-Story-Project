      In the decaying kingdom of Varesth, a curse had spread like a plague,
      twisting men into beasts and turning the dead into restless shadows.
      You are a forsaken knight who has returned to his homeland,
      drawn by whispers of an artifact, the Heart of the Hollow Veil.
      Said to break the curse or doom the land forever.
